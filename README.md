* **No Code Required**: Design complex interfaces without needing to write any C code. GCO handles the underlying Win32 API calls for you
* **Resource Loading**: GCO saves your designs in a `.gco` file, which can be loaded as a resource in your application. This allows you to easily recreate your UI at runtime.
* **Customization**: Full control over the look and feel of your interface with options for colors, fonts, and element properties.
